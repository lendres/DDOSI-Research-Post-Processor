This library implements the algorithm found in:
"Segmentation of well logs by maximum likelihood estimation: the algorithm and FORTRAN-77 implementation" by S.Radhakrishnan, G.Srikanth, and C.H.Mehta

The original algorithm was written in Fortran.  This version converts it to C++ and C#.  In addition, the following changes have been made:
	- Removed a bug from the GETSPK/GetSpikeyZone function.
	- Added the ability to filter returned segments to remove short/small segments.

CPP Static Library
	SegmentSignalFunctions.*
		These files implement the orginal algorithm in C++.  The function names have changed to something more readable.  The original function names can be found in the comments in
		the .cpp file.  The functions have otherwise been largely straight converted from Fortran and should be easily comparable to the source paper.
	SegmentSignal.*
		A class interface to the functions that makes use of the algorithm easier.
	SegmentationResults.*
		Small class to return results of the algorithm.
	NoiseVarianceEstimateMethod.h
		Enumeration for the noise variance estimation method.

CPP DLL
	DLL wrapper around the main SegmentSignal function.

C Sharp DLL Wrapper
	C# interface to the DLL.  Classes mirror those in C++.

* Unit Tests
	Testing projects.
